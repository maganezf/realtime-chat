## :construction_worker: How to Run

```bash
# First have sure that you have the nodejs (prefer Latest LTS Version) installed on your machine
# Clone Repository and change directory to project
$ git clone https://github.com/maganezf/realtime-chat.git && cd realtime-chat
```

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies and run the server application
# Option 1 - Using NPM (installed by default with node):
$ cd server && npm i & npm run socket

# Option 2 - Using yarn (need to be installed on the machine):
$ cd server && yarn & yarn socket

# Option 3 - Using pnpm (need to be installed on the machine):
$ cd server && pnpm i & pnpm socket
```

```bash
# 2. Install dependencies and run the client application
# Option 1 - Using NPM (installed by default with node):
$ cd client && npm i & npm run dev

# Option 2 - Using yarn (need to be installed on the machine):
$ cd client && yarn & yarn dev

# Option 3 - Using pnpm (need to be installed on the machine):
$ cd client && pnpm i & pnpm dev
```

```bash
# Check logs in the console for better understanding (server and client)
```

Your server will be running at <http://localhost:3333> <br/> And go to
<http://localhost:3000> (on your browser) to see the client and the final
results.
